   *  SparkFun says:   
   *  "To measure to higher degrees of precision use the following sensor settings:
   * ADC_256 (must be 1 mbar)
   * ADC_512 (...0.6 mbar)
   * ADC_1024 (...0.4 mbar)

   * Beth comment: And if 1 bar of pressure ~= 30 feet or 10 m, the approximate accuracy of the sensor is
   * 10 m * 0.2 mbar = 0.002 meters (or 2 mm). I think we can live with that for this project. 
   * (1 bar = 10.19 m of fresh water if we wish to be more precise.)
